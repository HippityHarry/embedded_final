/*
Question 2: System requirements:
  1. Clock for the CPU is at 50 MHz (checked)
  2. ADC channel 7 (12-bit A/D converter with reference voltage, Vref = 3.3 V )
is used to continuously sample analog voltage at GPIO port A pin 7 and convert
it into a corresponding digital value. The configuration for ADC:
    - ADC clock frequency is 1 MHz
    - Operating mode: continuous scan
  3. SPI2 of the NUC140 MCU will be configured as a master device to transmit
data to an off-chip slave device (in this Assignment, we donâ€™t have to worry
about what device is this). The configuration for the SPI2:
    - SPI serial clock is 1 MHz
    - SPI serial clock is IDLE at HIGH state
    - Data bit is transmitted on the POSITIVE edge of serial clock
    - Data is transferred from LSB first
    - One BYTE of data to be transmitted/received in a transaction
    - SPI2 pins: GPIOD.0 (SPI2_SS), GPIOD.1 (SPI2_CLK), GPIOD.3 (SPI2_MOSI)
